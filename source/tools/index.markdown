The real value of Bodeco consulting is the amount of experience that we have with
a large cross section of tools that can be used to build automation solutions.

# Configuration Management

## Puppet

Our configuration management solution of choice is [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet).
We come from a very strong background of implementing solutions with Puppet. The two co-founders
of Bodeco were both early employees of Puppet Labs (the 1st and 3rd hire in professional services).
We have contributed code to almost every major project and module in the Puppet ecosystem.

We are well known as some of the top Puppet experts in the world, and have even authored
a [book](shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026860.do) on writing Ruby extensions with Puppet.
